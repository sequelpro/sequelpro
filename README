BUILDING SEQUEL PRO
-------------------

Before you can start making changes to any of the xib files in Interface 
Builder you will need to install the BWToolkit plugin from 
http://www.brandonwalkin.com/bwtoolkit/.

To install the plugin you will need to do a Release build of the project so 
that the BWTookit plugin and frameworks are compiled.

Once you have done this double click on the BWToolkit.ibplugin located at:

	./trunk/Frameworks/BWToolkitFramework.framework/build/Release/

If Interface Builder complains that it's already installed then you might want 
to replace the current one with the one you just built.

To do this go to the Interface Builder preferences and click on 'Plugins' and
remove the BWToolkit plugin using the [ - ] button below the list.

You will need to relaunch Interface Builder before you can re-add the plugin 
from the location mentioned above.

Note, that Interface Builder always looks in the same location that the plugin 
was originally installed from and does not keep track of it when moved. If
Interface Builder complains that it can't find it, either restore it to its 
originally location or re-add it using the steps above.

As a last resort jump onto IRC and join #sequel-pro on irc.freenode.net and 
any of the developers will be happy to help you out.
